    <h1>Website Overview</h1>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>1. Home Page (Index)</h2>
      <p>
        The Home Page is the starting point of our web application, designed to
        provide users with an intuitive and visually pleasing shopping
        experience. At the top, we have a well-structured header that enhances
        navigation:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The website logo is positioned on the left side for brand recognition.
        </li>
        <li>
          The search functionality is centered in the header, allowing users to
          quickly find products by name or category.
        </li>
        <li>
          To the right, we have navigation links such as Home, Cart, and Bag,
          providing easy access to various sections.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Product Display:</strong> The main section of the homepage
        showcases 20 products at a time. Each product is presented with an
        image, price, and a short description. Users can quickly glance at
        essential details before making a purchase decision. Products are laid
        out in an organized grid, offering a seamless browsing experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Add to Cart Functionality:</strong> Every product features an
        Add to Cart button, which allows users to instantly add that product to
        their cart. This functionality is powered by JavaScript, ensuring that
        the product’s image, name, description, and price are all captured when
        added.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Footer:</strong> At the bottom of the page, the footer contains
        essential links and company information, rounding off the user
        experience on the homepage.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>2. Cart Page</h2>
      <p>
        The Cart Page is where users can review and manage the products they’ve
        added from the homepage. The layout is consistent with the homepage but
        has a distinct style to avoid conflicts in CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Cart Layout:</strong> All products added to the cart are
        displayed in a single column format. Each row contains:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A checkbox for selecting the product.</li>
        <li>An image for quick visual identification.</li>
        <li>The product’s name, description, and price.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Dynamic Actions:</strong> Users can select multiple products
        using the checkboxes, and the total price of the selected products is
        automatically updated. There are also buttons for removing individual
        items from the cart or proceeding to the checkout page. All of this is
        managed through JavaScript, making the experience dynamic and
        responsive.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>3. Checkout Page</h2>
      <p>
        The Checkout Page is the final step before completing the purchase. Upon
        arriving here, users see a summary of the products they’ve selected on
        the Cart Page. This page displays:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The product image, name, description, and price.</li>
        <li>A calculated total price of all the selected products.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>User Form:</strong> Below the product summary, a customer
        details form allows users to enter their personal information, including
        their name, address, and phone number. This data is crucial for
        processing the order and delivery.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Order Submission:</strong> Once users fill out the form and
        click the Submit Order button, the information is sent to the database.
        The backend stores both the product details and customer data, ensuring
        the order is properly recorded and processed.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>4. Database Integration</h2>
      <p>
        The database is the backbone of our application, where all critical data
        is stored and managed. It handles:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Product Data:</strong> Information about all available
          products, including their name, price, description, and image URLs, is
          fetched from the database and dynamically displayed on the home page.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cart and Order Data:</strong> When a user adds a product to
          the cart, the product details are temporarily held, but upon checkout,
          the order details are saved in the database along with customer
          information. This ensures a smooth flow from product selection to
          order completion.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </body>
